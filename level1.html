                <p id="infolvl1text">The Level 1 Digital Technologies course is designed for students who possess creative thinking abilities, logical reasoning skills, and problem-solving capabilities. It goes beyond simply using and consuming digital technologies and empowers students to become innovators, creating new technologies for real-world applications. In this course, students will acquire a foundation in computer science and programming concepts that underpin the development of digital technologies. They will leverage computational thinking to tackle problems by crafting algorithms for digital devices and will design and deliver digital solutions in alignment with the new digital technologies curriculum.

                Furthermore, students will learn how to design digital media projects such as websites, videos, and display boards using tools like HTML/CSS, Adobe Photoshop, and InDesign. They will employ iterative processes to develop digital programming solutions, utilizing planning tools like MS Project and text-based programming languages like Python and JavaScript. Additionally, the course will impart an understanding of human-computer interaction through the study of usability heuristics and introduce students to the ethical dilemmas that are arising in our digital society.

                Importantly, this course exposes students to software and concepts commonly used in various industries. These skills are not only valuable for further education but are also highly sought after by employers. At the end of the year, students can make informed decisions about whether they want to pursue courses with a focus on Digital Technologies and multimedia information systems (2DIT) and/or computer science and programming (2DIP).
