                <p id="infolvl1text">Building upon the foundational knowledge acquired in Level 1 Digital Technologies, this course serves as a natural progression. It is specifically tailored for students who harbor a deep-seated interest in programming and computer science, particularly those who are contemplating a future in software development as a potential career or a subject of study at the tertiary level. The course curriculum encompasses a wide array of subjects, including program planning, processes, development, and computer networking.

                    In the pursuit of these objectives, students will make use of software tools such as Notepad++ or similar applications, a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Draw.io, and Trello. Within the course, students will not only acquire but also implement advanced tools and techniques in Python, allowing them to create sophisticated computer programs. Furthermore, they will gain a profound understanding of advanced computer science concepts, including but not limited to computer security, encryption, error control, complexity and tractability, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, students will learn advanced methodologies for building computer networks.
